I created a new account to  Portswigger Academy and opened up the lab: "Lab: SQL injection vulnerability in WHERE clause allowing retrieval of hidden data"
The goal of this lab is to gain access to the hidden data on the site.
I installed Burp Suite and proceeded to enter the target site's address into the target tab, which opened up the traffic of packets

I then transferred url featuring category function into the repeater tab and changed the category to "'+OR+1=1--" instead of "Accessories"

sending this packet shows in results all the hidden items you normally dont see

B) HTB

I created a HackTheBox account as instructed

C) Meow

I set up the openvpn connection to the Meow Virtual machine

This machine has 9 Tasks to complete

1 What does VM stand for?
- Virtual Machine

2 What tool do we use to interact with the operating system in order to issue commands via the command line, such as the one to start our VPN connection? It's also known as a console or shell. 
- Terminal

3 What service do we use to form our VPN connection into HTB labs? 
- openvpn

4 What is the abbreviated name for a 'tunnel interface' in the output of your VPN boot-up sequence output? 
- tun

5 What tool do we use to test our connection to the target with an ICMP echo request? 
- Ping

6 What is the name of the most common tool for finding open ports on a target? 
- nmap

7 What service do we identify on port 23/tcp during our scans? 
- telnet

8 What username is able to log into the target over telnet with a blank password? 
- root

9 Submit root flag 
- This can be found in a file called flag.txt

And with that the machine is pwned
