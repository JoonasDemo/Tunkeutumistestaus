I created a new account to  Portswigger Academy and opened up the lab: "Lab: SQL injection vulnerability in WHERE clause allowing retrieval of hidden data"
The goal of this lab is to gain access to the hidden data on the site.
I installed Burp Suite and proceeded to enter the target site's address into the target tab, which opened up the traffic of packets

I then transferred url featuring category function into the repeater tab and changed the category to "'+OR+1=1--" instead of "Accessories"

sending this packet shows in results all the hidden items you normally dont see
