**x) Lue ja tiivistä (Tässä x-alakohdassa ei tarvitse tehdä testejä tietokoneella, vain lukeminen tai kuunteleminen ja tiivistelmä riittää. Tiivistämiseen riittää muutama ranskalainen viiva. Cheatsheetistä voit poimia muutaman itselle relevantin kohdan.)**

- Cialdini's 6 principles are a collection of marketing tactics to trick people to purchase their product
- Some of these methods vary in legality depending on legislation on per country basis
- These techniques can be utilized in multitude of ways but they mostly benefit marketers, though you will benefit from knowing when these are being used against you so you are less likely to be conned from your money

**SQL Inject Union**

- A UNION attack exploits the vurnerabilities in an SQL database to show you values you're not meant to see such as number of columns on a table
- Using this information you can trick the system into giving you further information with the UNION SELECT command
- You can also retrieve multiple values in a single line using the "double pipe" method

**a) Kalastelu keihäskalasteluviesti (spear phising) kuvitteelliselle yritykselle. Tavoitteena on saada kohde avaamaan liitteenä oleva Excel-dokumentti ja laittamaan makrot päälle. Käytä ainakin kahta Cialdinin periaatetta. Selitä, miten näitä periaatteita on sovellettu viestiisi. Keksi skennario ja kohde itse. Käytä työssä vain kuvitteellisia yrityksiä ja henkilöitä. Viestiä ei lähetetä mihinkään, se tulee vain raporttiin. Liitteenä olevaa Excel-dokumenttia ei tarvitse tehdä, mutta jos siinä on jotain nokkelaa, voit kuvailla, mitä se olisi.**

Scenario feature's a fictitious company "Generic Bank" their CEO "Goofus Maximus" and their naive employee "Mark Scatterburg"

*Greetings Mr. Scatterburg
Our Company Employee welfare universal have been commissioned by your CEO Goofus Maximus to perform a employee wellfare review. To briefly summarize our company; We make a push for fairness and treatment of all employees, out of all our 152 clients we have seen 84% increase in employee worklife balance and general happiness.
However, we are well aware that some employees may feel pressured by their management to review their workplace as more positive than they possibly are, thus our form allows you to stay completely anonymous. If you wish to leave your form as anonymous, when you open our questionaire, the program will ask you to enable macros, enabling this will allow the program to automatically remove all possible identifying information from the questionaire.*

This message uses 3 of Cialdini's 6 principles: 
- Authority in a form of mention of the CEO by name
- Liking in terms of being more relatable to a common workers blights by offering sympathy and chance to stay anonymous 
- Consensus by citing the fictional number of companies and their boost in employee welfare

**Portswigger labs exercises**

**b) SQL injection vulnerability allowing login bypass.**
I opened up the target webpage in Burp Suite

I turned on the intercept function on the proxy tab
I fumbled around as i was admittedly feeling rusty i tried some standard logins like admin

I looked up on SQL portswigger injection page and tried the following command on an intercepted log in attempt: *' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users-- '*
This logged me into an account called "wiener" but not administrator

![image](https://github.com/JoonasDemo/Tunkeutumistestaus/blob/main/Portswigger1.jpg)

so this is where i caved and looked at the solution where the solution was to instead send *administrator'--* and thus log in as them, which i then tried and successfully logged in

**c) SQL injection UNION attack, determining the number of columns returned by the query.**

For this exercise we are supposed to determine how many columns there are

I didn't start too far from the actually solution
I opened up one of the tabs and intercepted it, i started to look for the filter/category section and soon found it

![image](https://github.com/JoonasDemo/Tunkeutumistestaus/blob/main/Portswigger5.jpg)

Following what i read in exercise x, i entered a command *'+UNION+SELECT+NULL--*
which resulted in the following error

![image](https://github.com/JoonasDemo/Tunkeutumistestaus/blob/main/Portswigger4.jpg)

I tried again with one added *NULL* ('+UNION+SELECT+NULL,NULL--) and got the same error, but what's this? With a third *NULL* i got something different (
'+UNION+SELECT+NULL,NULL,NULL--)


![image](https://github.com/JoonasDemo/Tunkeutumistestaus/blob/main/Portswigger3.jpg)

And so the lab was completed


**d) SQL injection UNION attack, finding a column containing text.**

Using the same method as in part C, i determined there are 3 Columns, i returned back to the Portswigger SQL inject page converning finding columns that take string data. I started probing them with *'+UNION+SELECT+NULL,'a',NULL--* command testing the 3 columns and found out that column two takes strings

![image](https://github.com/JoonasDemo/Tunkeutumistestaus/blob/main/Portswigger7.jpg)

According to the exercise i now have to make the table print a set combination of characters which i did by replacing the 'a'
 in the code with set word
 
 ![image](https://github.com/JoonasDemo/Tunkeutumistestaus/blob/main/Portswigger8.jpg)
 
 and thus the lab was done

**e) SQL injection UNION attack, retrieving data from other tables.**

This next exercise brings all the other ones together so:

First we test the number of columns, which turns out to be 2

 ![image](https://github.com/JoonasDemo/Tunkeutumistestaus/blob/main/Portswigger9.jpg)
 
 Second we check with ones accept strings, which turn out to be both
 
  ![image](https://github.com/JoonasDemo/Tunkeutumistestaus/blob/main/Portswigger10.jpg)
  
  So now for the new part with what we know by the assignment, there is a table users with fields: username and password
  Applying this knowledge i put in this string: *'+UNION+SELECT+username,password+FROM+users--*
  This prints out this tasty piece of information
  
  ![image](https://github.com/JoonasDemo/Tunkeutumistestaus/blob/main/Portswigger11.jpg)

  As per assignment i copy the administrator password and use it to log in thus completing the assignment

**f) SQL injection UNION attack, retrieving multiple values in a single column.**

This assignment wants us to print both username and password into a single column, i remember seeing something about this on the SQL inject tutorial so i take a look and find this bit of syntax *' UNION SELECT username || '~' || password FROM users--* due to different system the syntax needs to be converted, so i experiment so i try the following which leads to an error *'+UNION+SELECT+username+||+'~'+||+password--*
I then realize i forgot like an idiot that i need to specify from which table to pull from which after experimenting it leads to this *'+UNION+SELECT+NULL,username||'~'||password+FROM+users--*

![image](https://github.com/JoonasDemo/Tunkeutumistestaus/blob/main/Portswigger13.jpg)

I then use this info to log in

**g) SQL injection attack, querying the database type and version on Oracle.**

Now we move to an oracle based system which regardless of case always demands a target table. For this purpose we can use a table which exists in all Oracles *DUAL* with this i found the amount of columns, that being 2 using this line *'+UNION+SELECT+NULL,NULL+FROM+DUAL--*

![image](https://github.com/JoonasDemo/Tunkeutumistestaus/blob/main/Portswigger15.jpg)

Second i check if the columns take strings, which both ones do *'+UNION+SELECT+'a','a'+FROM+DUAL--*

Checking the cheat sheet it the command to run if you want to see the database version *SELECT banner FROM v$version*

I had to try a few different times to convert it into proper syntax and fill the additional field with null for it to work so i ended with
*'+UNION+SELECT+banner,NULL+FROM+v$version--*

This seems to have worked and thus i completed the assignment
