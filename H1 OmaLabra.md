Darknet Diaries EP6: The Beirut Bank Job Summary
- Jayson is a genius when it comes to using psychology and charisma to bypass physical security
- Despite being in a foreign country that does not speak his primary language, he's able to effectively manipulate human psychology to convince people to let him into places he has right to be in.
- With only a few tools he's able to compromise multiple devices in a short time
- While he "robbed" the wrong bank and got away scot free it could have ended incredibly poorly for him since he was doing technically criminal things
- I can see how many employees would simply ignore someone who looks like they are there on official business.
